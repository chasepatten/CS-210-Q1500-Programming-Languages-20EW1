# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I chose Project One as I havent had my second project graded yet and my third project has not even been started due to technical issues that SNHU IT Support has been trying to help me fix. The project itself is is a clock that shows time in both 12 and 24 hoour formats. It also allows the user to add a hour, minute or second as they wish by choosing the options in the menu. This clock format was to meet the ISO 8601 standard.

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I did a good job of commenting all of my code to make sure anyone reading it will understand what every functon and variable is and what it is used for. I also think I did a good job on creating the functions that would help to program and display the clock to the user. I also think I did a good job in figuring out the algorithms needed to calculate the times.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Instead of using IF statements to allow the user to make choices I could of used switch statements instead. This maybe could of created a simpler and more clean choice selection apparatus for the menu's and the adding hour, minute, and seconds.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found trying to calculate the times correctly to be challenging. As I had to work backwards and forwards through the problems in order to make sure I had the right algorithm. It took more time than I would care to admit but, after working through the problem and figuring out how much of each unit of time equals to what lower unit of time helped. The tools I used for this were Google to look up things like the amount of seconds in an hour and so on.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I feel that the skills involved in working out a mathematical formula to put into a program to calculate something is a good skill to have. I do not know how often this will come up in real world applications in the field but, I imagine the problem solving aspect of it will be helpful in the future.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure that everything was placed into a function. I also made sure that there was proper spacing in between everything and that every variable and function was commented fully to make sure the reader understands what is going on.
